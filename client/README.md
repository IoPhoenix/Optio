## Styling Options

There are three ways to style components:

-   Use theme.js to override Material UI default styles. This will affect the whole application!

-   Add group of styles to styles folder and import it in the component (refer to Signup or Login pages for help) for reusable styling

-   As an alternative, use Material UI withStyles or makeStyles to style each component separately
